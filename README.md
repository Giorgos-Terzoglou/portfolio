# Terzo — Evidence-First Portfolio

**Live:** https://portfolio-six-nu-sttotzohgd.vercel.app/

Terzo is an evidence-first portfolio for **Georgios Terzoglou**.

It’s designed as a structured interview experience: instead of scrolling through static pages, you navigate topics the same way an interviewer would — experience, projects, publications — with proof attached wherever it matters.

If something can’t be backed up, it doesn’t belong here.

## What this is (and what it’s not)

**This is:**
- A deterministic, guided walkthrough of real experience
- Focused on systems, pipelines, and outcomes
- Backed by concrete evidence (code, demos, papers, project sites)

**This is not:**
- A chatbot
- A marketing landing page
- A keyword-stuffed CV replacement

---

## How to use it

Use the topic chips at the top to navigate:
- **Experience** — end-to-end ownership in production and research
- **Projects** — flagship systems with architecture, trade-offs, and limitations
- **Publications** — applied research tied to real systems
- **Education** — academic background and thesis
- **Contact** — email, CV, and professional links

The interface is intentionally constrained:  
you can’t “chat” freely — input routes you to the correct section based on intent.

## Design philosophy

- **Evidence first**: claims appear only where proof exists
- **Short answers**: details are revealed on demand
- **No fluff**: no buzzwords, no padding, no vanity metrics
- **Interview-oriented**: mirrors how technical discussions actually happen

---

## Tech stack (high level)

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js
- **State & flow:** deterministic JSON-driven interview graph
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Media:** static assets + embedded demos

The core logic lives in a single flow definition that controls navigation, answers, and evidence.

## Why this format

Most portfolios optimize for scrolling.  
This one optimizes for **decision-making**.

If you’re evaluating engineering depth, system thinking, or real-world impact, this format gets you there faster.

## Contact

- **Email:** available in the Contact section
- **GitHub / LinkedIn:** linked directly in the portfolio
- **CV:** downloadable from the Contact section

If you’re reviewing this as a recruiter or engineer:  
start with **Experience**, then jump into **Projects** for depth.
